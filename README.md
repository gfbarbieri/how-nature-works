# Simulations from How Nature Works by Per Bak
How Nature Works introduces the concepet of self-organization and demonstrates the universality of a particular systemic property called "self-organized criticality" or SOC. The thesis of the book is that SOC is a universal property of systems seen in nature and potentially social systems.

The book is available online for free [here.](http://blairgemmer.com/docs/BakTang/HowNatureWorks-PerBak.pdf)

## Description
The book discusses several prominent models used to study complex systems, in particular the emergence of a property called self-organized criticality. Three models interest me: The Sandpile Model, The Game of Life, and The Model of a Critical Economy. These are not the "official" names of these models. In this notebook, I have so far produced demonstrations of The Sandpile Model and The Game of Life.
