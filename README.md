# Simulations from How Nature Works by Per Bak
How Nature Works introduces the concepet of self-organization and demonstrates the universality of a particular systemic property called "self-organized criticality" or SOC. The thesis of the book is that SOC is a universal property of systems seen in nature and potentially social systems.

## Description
The book discusses several prominent models used to study complex systems and the self-organized criticality. Three that interest me are The Sandpile Model, The Game of Life, and The Model of a Critical Economy. In this notebook, I have so far produced demonstrations of The Sandpile Model and The Game of Life.
